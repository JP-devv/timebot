Simple timecard bot that automatically logs in to UTRGV and fills out your timecard appropriately.

You must define your schedule in the timecard_bot.py file, and create a file called credentials in
the same folder and put in your credentials like such

john.appleseed01@utrgv.edu
ApplesAndBananas123

The file will use these and will automatically log you in.

Keep in mind that this bot only works on campus wifi, or in the use of a VPN else you wont be able
to access people soft
